It first explains the definition of lacquerware (objects coated with natural raw lacquer from lacquer trees, initially for practical use and later developing artistic value) and the prosperity of Tang Dynasty lacquer craftsmanship due to strong national power and developed economy. It then details the box's features: mother-son mouth, black lacquer inside and out, slightly convex lid and base, with a pair of silver pingtuo running deer on the lid and sparse silver pingtuo flower and leaf patterns around the box (consistent with Tang Dynasty gold and silverware patterns). Finally, it introduces the complex silver pingtuo process (cutting thin silver sheets, pasting on lacquerware, applying black lacquer until flush with silver sheets, polishing to reveal patterns) and notes that Tang Dynasty lacquerware is rare today, making gold and silver pingtuo lacquerware even more precious.",

In 2024, the State Administration for Market Regulation and other departments clearly defined pre-prepared dishes at the national level: they are pre-packaged dishes made from edible agricultural products and their products, processed industrially, and edible only after heating or cooking, with requirements such as 'no preservatives added' and 'promoting clear indication of pre-prepared dishes in catering links'. As a product of food industrialization, pre-prepared dishes are popular for convenience; there are over 70,000 related enterprises in China, the market scale is expected to exceed 600 billion yuan in 2025, and Guangdong's export volume of pre-prepared dishes reached 31.7 billion yuan in 2024. However, the industry still needs improvement; the core of public discussion is not rejecting pre-prepared dishes but demanding 'clear information about what they eat'. The article suggests refining national standards, strengthening supervision, and urging catering enterprises to innovate, focus on consumer needs and operate with honesty. It also notes that both freshly cooked dishes (with 'wok aroma') and standardized pre-prepared dishes have their audiences, and consumers care about food safety, value equivalence and information transparency.",

"summary_en": "After a four-year delay, the streaming platform Spotify finally launched 24-bit/44.1 kHz lossless music. Prior to this, Spotify faced a large-scale user migration to Apple Music, mainly due to issues such as increasing membership fees, a large number of AI singers on the platform, lack of lossless music, and unfair profit sharing for real singers. Apple Music even collaborated with online music migration services to provide a one-click migration function, and Spotify's migration service was constantly in a busy state during that period. However, when users demanded lossless music, many netizens criticized them, asking questions like 'What do you need lossless music for?', 'How can you talk about music quality with Bluetooth headsets?', and 'Are you sure your ears can tell the difference in sound quality?'. The author believes that users' demand for better services is normal, and everyone could potentially benefit from such demands, so those who voice demands should be thanked instead of criticized. The author also mentions that this phenomenon has changed his view of the Internet and netizens—he no longer cares about the 'crowd' but focuses on individual readers, and his supposedly milder words in recent years are actually due to not caring about what strangers say, as 'whether one is cold or warm depends on oneself'.",

"summary_en": "The author shares a simple observation: 'Personality is above everything else.' In the past, the author was used to classifying people by preferences (e.g., disliking aggressive or unthinking individuals) and seeking a sense of belonging in specific groups, using dichotomies to find a 'comfortable and safe position.' However, as age increased, the author's sense of group belonging collapsed—realizing that most'shared values' are just common slogans for identity recognition, and belonging itself is unnecessary. After returning to a 'pure individual identity,' the author began to view others as individuals instead of categorizing them. This change made people more vivid and understandable, leading to the conclusion that personality matters most. The author points out that character, viewpoints, and positions are often superficial or even just rhetorical habits; what truly counts is how a person acts in practice. For example, during the pandemic, friends who might be 'looked down on' (e.g., seemingly dull or conservative) would take the initiative to deliver medicine, while those 'admired' (e.g., smart or rational) might not help. The author also criticizes intellectuals who gloat over an opponent's shooting death due to ideological conflicts, emphasizing that such people are far from 'human' in terms of personality, making their theories or positions meaningless.",

The key is that the latter often extends their hand instinctively, without thinking or saying any nice words—and this is what I call personality.",
